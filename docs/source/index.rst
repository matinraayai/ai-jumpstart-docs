AI Jumpstart Cluster Documentation
===================================
This documentation includes necessary info get started on
using the AI Jumpstart cluster, hosted by Northeastern University's
Research Computing (RC) Team at Massachusetts Green High Performance Center (MGHPCC) in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
This documentation is intended for users external to Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.
Keep in mind that the Research Computing team maintains its own set of
documentation `<here https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/>`_. Our goal is to complement the RC documentation;
At times where the required information is discussed thoroughly in the RC documentation, a direct link to the RC
documentation page is provided. Discrepancies, and tailored information targeted to this document's
intended audience which was not provided in the RC documentation, is expanded upon.
