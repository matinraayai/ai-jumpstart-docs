Using Slurm
===========
Slurm (Simple Linux Utility Resource Management) is the cluster management and job scheduling system on the Discovery
cluster. It can be used to view information about the partitions on the cluster and manage/monitor jobs.
See :external:doc:`using-discovery/usingslurm` for a list of basic commands to use on AI Jumpstart and
`Slurm Documentation <https://slurm.schedmd.com>`_ for a more in-depth documentation of Slurm features.

Viewing Partition Info to Use with Slurm
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Slurm allows users to view information about the partitions they have access to via command line utilities ``sinfo``,
``scontrol``, and ``sacct``. See :external:doc:`hardware/hardware_overview` for a list of usage examples that can be used
on the ``ai-jumpstart`` partition.
